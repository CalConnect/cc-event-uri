== Future work

As mentioned in <<sec-2.2.2>>, the data URI scheme would be a
nice fit for providing an uniform format for specifying events in the
Web and printed media (QR and other formats), and we have only chosen
another method because data support is currently limited.

We plan to update this document with a data URI compatible format as
soon as its support is more widespread, allowing it to be used by
native applications, browser applications and physical media with the
same support currently available for regular URIs. The format
specified here is compatible with data URI and minimal changes would
be needed to convert from one format to another.
