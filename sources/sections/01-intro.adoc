== Introduction

Calendar users currently often do not have the ability to quickly add
an event to their default calendar app, when encountering event data
on a webpage, poster or mobile apps. In this sense events have
fallen behind other real world entities, like e-mail <<RFC6068>> and
geo coordinates <<RFC5870>> which allow for performing actions in
default apps when encountering these entities anywhere. This
recommendations document addresses the problem by proposing best
practices when embedding and publishing calendar data. We believe
that using a standardized URI scheme for event publishing will make
populating of users' calendars much simpler, will make developers'
lives easier and will increase calendar apps usage in general. A
major additional benefit of URIs is sharing of events on physical
media (for example via QR codes) or via URL.
