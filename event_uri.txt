Internet-Draft                  Event URI                    August 2015


1.  Introduction

   Calendar users currently often do not have the ability to quickly
   perform an action, such as adding the event to your default calendar
   app, when encountering event data on a webpage, poster or mobile
   apps.  In this sense events have fallen behind other real world
   entities, like e-mail [RFC6068] and geo coordinates [RFC5870] which
   allow for performing actions in default apps when encountering these
   entities anywhere.  This recommendations document addresses the
   problem by proposing best practices when embedding and publishing
   calendar data.  We believe that using a standardized URI scheme for
   event publishing will make populating of users' calendars much
   simpler, will make developers' lives easier and will increase
   calendar apps usage in general.  A major benefit of URIs is not only
   allowing creation on mobile devices but also sharing of events on
   physical media (for example via QR codes).

2.  Motivation and related work

2.1.  Current event publishing practices

   Due to lack of standardized way to add events to calendar apps many
   different ways to do this developed.  We will briefly mention four
   common ways: using a download link, hCalendar embedding, using
   VEVENTs in QR codes and provider specific buttons.

2.1.1.  Publish a link to an iCalendar file

   A simple way to publish an event is write the event information into
   an iCalendar [RFC5545] file and provide a link to an user for
   download it.  In an ideal world, a user would click on the link
   pointing to a file, the browser would recognize this link as a
   calendar file and redirect it to the proper calendar application,
   which would display the event information to the user, let him do
   simple edit actions, and save it to the calendar.

   Unfortunately, there are some roadblocks.  Browsers may not recognize
   ICS files and calendar apps may not be registered to handle them.
   Users end up forced to download ICS files and depending on their
   operating system they can either click on the file and get it handed
   over to their calendar app or they need to go to their calendar app
   and manually import the event.  Downloading files also means we need
   proper support from the hosting entity, and sometimes this is either
   simply not available (for instance, some CMS hosts do not have in-
   place support for special types of files) or require special plug-
   ins.

Internet-Draft                  Event URI                    August 2015


   The last problem we will mention is about coupling of the file and
   the entity it represents.  Currently the user needs to keep the event
   file and all the links and descriptions in the links about in sync
   (containing the same information).  It would be preferable to have
   this information close together.  Ideally the same tools used to
   generate a page could be used to assure a link and the text
   information being displayed are synchronized.

2.1.2.  Current QR code implementations

   Several QR code readers ([ZXing][i-nigma]) support calendar events to
   be embedded in QR codes, but they have their own custom
   implementation, usually a single VEVENT iCalendar component.  They
   work well on the mobile platform but rely on OS internals
   [CalendarContract] to add the event to the calendar.

2.1.3.  hCalendar

   hCalendar [hCalendar] is a microformat for events that can be used to
   annotate a web page or another document and indicate to readers that
   an event is present.  While microformats are useful for parsing, they
   are not as easy as clicking on a link to add an event and usually
   require some complex interaction between the website and the calendar
   application to get it right.  This also makes it not ideal for QR
   scanning, since the annotations were not designed to represent the
   whole content of a document, they are more appropriate as an
   annotation on a previously structured text.

2.1.4.  Custom calendar application link

   Several calendar systems provide URL for event creation
   ([AddThisEvent][GoogleCalendar]).  However, due to lack of standards,
   applications must implement and link to these separately.  For a web
   site owner it means implementing all custom links individually and
   presenting them to the users.  The users then needs to choose the one
   that will work for their calendar application.  This consumes
   precious space on the page and requires understanding of several
   APIs, making it difficult for a developer that wants to just publish
   a simple event.

2.2.  Alternative implementations

   In this section we would like to explore some other possible
   implementations that, although not currently used by the most popular
   calendar applications, could theoretically converge into a standard.
   We will talk briefly about the calendar mime type and
   RegisterContentHandler, data URI scheme and a custom URI scheme.

2.2.1.  text/calendar MIME type and RegisterContentHandler

   One way to use iCal files and avoid downloading it would be
   registering a handler for calendar MIME [RFC6838] types (text/
   calendar [RFC5545]).  Operating Systems know how to handle mime type
   properly, and would be able to redirect it to the right application.
   Web browsers, on the other hand, still have limited capability to
   handle it, the method RegisterContentHandler [RegisterContentHandler]
   allows to send a given mime type file directly to a website, but so
   far has only been implemented by Mozilla and only supports atom/xml
   MIME type.

2.2.2.  data URI

   Data URIs [RFC2397] can be used to replace an external file in an
   HTML.  One advantage is that it gets embedded into the HTML and
   removes the need of an external file, either a real file or emulated.
   Unfortunately, browsers treat these the same way they treat files,
   therefore they would still need to be downloaded or properly
   redirected to an application, and RegisterContentHandler would need
   to be implemented by browsers and QR readers before this approach can
   be used

2.2.3.  Custom URI scheme

   A custom URI scheme for events would behave similar to e-mail
   [RFC6068] geo [RFC5870] and other schemes, where the resource
   (e-mail, geo, or in this case, the event) is properly identified and
   follows a specified protocol.  An HTML page could publish an event
   using this scheme (as it would with any other link format) or a print
   page could embed it in an 2D-barcode.  The user would have several
   options of handling it: opening his application of choice, or
   redirecting to a previously registered website
   [RegisterProtocolHandler].  Support for URI schemes is widespread,
   most Operating Systems and browsers support it and its associated
   APIs.

3.  The event URI scheme

   In this section we will propose a custom URI schema that could be
   implemented easily by any calendar application and developers alike,
   discuss some of its special requirements and last provide some
   examples

Internet-Draft                  Event URI                    August 2015


3.1.  Syntax

   The event URI scheme syntax is based on both iCalendar [RFC5545] and
   data URI scheme [RFC2397], we intend to make it trivial for people
   used to iCalendar syntax to implement this scheme, and also make it
   consistent with other existing URI formats.  The basic syntax for the
   URI is:

                             event:[base64,] icalendar event

   To be compatible with the generic URI syntax [RFC3986], the whole URI
   needs to follow the percent encoding escaping.  The iCalendar event
   can be either written as a escaped text or, if base64 is specified,
   converted to base64.  Calendar applications MUST recognize both
   formats to be compliant with this URI scheme For the iCalendar the
   following restrictions apply:

   o  Exactly one entity in the VCALENDAR (VEVENT / VTODO) must be
      specified.

   o  MUST be a valid entity as specified by RFC 5545 [RFC5545], except
      for rules specified in this document that can violate the RFC
      specification

   o  Start and End dates MUST contain timezones, as described in
      section 3.8.2.2 and 3.8.2.4 of RFC 5545 [RFC5545]

   o  Timezones MUST be specified using one of the valid names from the
      IANA timezone database (tz) [tz].  Also, VTIMEZONE entries MUST
      NOT be added to the event URI or to the source files.  All
      calendar applications reading events will recognize these names
      (see Section 3.3.2 for more details)

   o  The event MUST contain a UID, as specified by section 3.8.4.7 of
      RFC 5545 [RFC5545]

   o  The VCALENDAR object MAY contain a SOURCE field
      [CalDavExtensions], pointing to an ICS file that can contain extra
      information about the event contained in the calendar.  If the
      source file and the entry contradict each other, the information
      presented in the source MUST prevail.  If a source is available,
      the event contained in the source file MUST have the same UID as
      the event expressed by the URI

   o  It MUST fit in the medium you're choosing to transmit it, For
      reference, URIs larger than 2048 characters are known to not work
      properly on all browsers, and QR codes have a hard limit of 2953
      characters in its most permissive encoding.  In practice, we

Internet-Draft                  Event URI                    August 2015


      recommend limiting the URI to 1024 characters and our tests have
      shown 500 characters are usually enough for most common scenarios.

   o  LAST-MODIFIED field, as specified by section 3.8.7.3 of RFC 5545
      [RFC5545] MUST be included to allow for changes to be detected by
      calendar handler applications

3.2.  Examples

3.2.1.  Event URI 101 - a simple example

   In this first example, we will start with a simple event that follows
   all the recommendations above.  This event starts on March 23rd,
   2233, at midnight and finishes at 11:59 PM at the same day, in
   Eastern Time.  It has been last modified on April 1st, 2015.  From
   these, we have the following icalendar event:

                   BEGIN:VCALENDAR
                   BEGIN:VEVENT
                   SUMMARY:James T. Kirk's birthday
                   DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern:22330322T000000
                   DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern:22330322T235900
                   UID:8726bc91-a168-4c42-9568-a0e7d35724d6@example.com
                   LAST-MODIFIED:20150401T000000Z
                   END:VEVENT
                   END:VCALENDAR

   which leads to the event URI:

                event:BEGIN%3AVCALENDAR%0D%0ABEGIN%3AVEVENT%0D%0ASUMMARY
                %3AJames%20T.%20Kirk%27s%20birthday%0D%0ADTSTART%3BTZID%3DUS

                20150401T000000Z%0D%0AEND%3AVEVENT%0D%0AEND%3AVCALENDAR

3.2.2.  Base 64 encoding

   As mentioned before, calendar applications also need to be able to
   interpret base64 versions of the URIs, the example below represents
   the same event described in Section 3.2.1:

              event:base64,QkVHSU46VkNBTEVOREFSDQpCRUdJTjpWRVZFTlQNClNVTU1BU
              lk6SmFtZXMgVC4gS2lyaydzIGJpcnRoZGF5DQpEVFNUQVJUO1RaSUQ9VVMvRWF

3.2.3.  Source link

   A source link should be added if the URI cannot fit all information
   about a given event or for any other reason you believe that an ICS
   file may better suit your needs.  For the same example in
   Section 3.2.1, we can add the source URL 'http://www.example.com/
   kirk.ics' and we would obtain the following URIs:

                event:BEGIN%3AVCALENDAR%0D%0ASOURCE%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.com
                %2Fkirk.ics%0D%0ABEGIN%3AVEVENT%0D%0ASUMMARY%3AJames%20T.%20Kirk%27

                FMRU5EQVI=

   The iCal object in this case would be:

                   BEGIN:VCALENDAR
                   SOURCE:http://www.example.com/kirk.ics
                   BEGIN:VEVENT
                   SUMMARY:James T. Kirk's birthday
                   DTSTART;TZID=US/Eastern:22330322T000000
                   DTEND;TZID=US/Eastern:22330322T235900
                   UID:f41cb1b3-e071-425d-a200-5e1384a22758@example.com
                   LAST-MODIFIED:20150401T000000Z
                   END:VEVENT
                   END:VCALENDAR

3.2.4.  Recurring instance with fragment identifier

   In this example, we have a recurring event with a fragment
   identifier, and its corresponding URI.  Note that this is the only
   way to specify a recurring event, since only one VEVENT is allowed in
   the URI.  Exceptions and other information related to this recurring
   event MUST be added to the SOURCE link instead.

      date information while the event information is relevant (i.e, the
      link must exist until the event expires).

   There are also some best practices that need to be followed by these
   publishers in regard to UID generation and the LAST-MODIFIED field,
   which are discussed in the following subsections.

3.3.1.1.  UID generation

   According to RFC 5545 [RFC5545], every event MUST be published with
   an UID, so calendar applications can detect multiple occurrences of
   it and remove them.  The UID MUST be a globally unique identifier,
   and the system generating the event must guarantee it is unique.  The
   recommended way is to generate an id that is internal to a given
   system (for instance, a database incremental id, an UUID, or
   something similar) and append the domain name or IP address at the
   end, separating them by an @.

   For example, all these are valid unique ids for domain example.com
   that fit this recommendation and also RFC 5545 [RFC5545]:

   o  [1@example.com]: a simple numerical id, useful if you are creating
      your first event and has no intention to create another or can
      manage the ids manually.

   o  [user-29960401T080000Z-1@example.com]: An UID for an event from
      user 'user' that starts April first, 2996, at 8:00 AM, and uses
      the username and date as keys.

   o  [f47935ee-ec5e-4d87-ba26-05e970674a88@example.com]: a UID which
      uses UUIDs based on RFC 4122 [RFC4122].  Theoretically, UUIDs are
      themselves unique, but to conform with the recommendation we also
      appended the domain name.

3.3.2.  Calendar applications requirements

   For calendar data handlers, the following set of extra rules apply:

   o  An event MUST only be handled by a calendar application after an
      user performed an action, like clicking on a link or scanning a QR
      code.  Events published using the URI SHOULD NOT be added
      automatically.

   o  Calendar data handlers MUST retain sufficient information to
      determine that an event has changed so that it can inform the
      user.

   o  If a user deletes a previously downloaded event the handler should
      recognize that and ignore the event unless explicitly clicked on.

   o  A calendar application must keep its timezone database always up-
      to-date and adjust events accordingly.  Timezones will be
      specified by reference (i.e., their ISO names, according to [tz])
      and any calendar application MUST understand these.

4.  Security and privacy considerations

   Below are some guidelines applications implementing event URI
   generators and parsers need to follow in order to avoid security and
   privacy issues.

   o  Whenever a SOURCE link is available, the application MUST ask the
      user whether he wants to follow the link, since there may be costs
      associated with downloading data and the user may want to perform
      this operation in a different environment.

   o  Calendar applications MAY check a SOURCE link periodically to
      check for changes, but MUST NOT update an event automatically
      based on new information provided by the user.  If new information
      is available through the SOURCE link, calendar applications SHOULD
      inform the user and ask for his consent before performing any
      change in his calendar.

   o  Reading an event URI or following a SOURCE link and downloading a
      file may pose a security thread if some care is not taken.
      Particularly code reading these files should be careful to not get
      exposed to common security bugs like buffer overflows.

   o  A SOURCE link SHOULD not be used only as a tracking mechanism, if
      a link is provided there should be some extra information being
      provided by it or at least the possibility that the information
      will be updated if necessary

   o  A SOURCE link MUST not require a calendar account in any calendar
      manager, and MUST NOT represent any form of event subscription by
      a particular system.  Any event subscription action REQUIRES user
      acknowledgement and approval before being performed.

   o  Note that there is no hard limit on the size of a SOURCE file, but
      it is expected that these contain information only about a single
      event (i.e., one VEVENT) or recurring event (several VEVENTS with
      the same RECURRENCE-ID) This has implications for both writers and
      readers of these source files:

      *  Writers MUST always provided well-formed data that complies to
         this document and, more generally, to iCalendar format
         [RFC5545].

      *  Readers can't rely on the size of an input to decide whether it
         is valid or not, and SHOULD implement parsers that detect
         inconsistencies.

5.  Future work

   As mentioned in section Section 2.2.2, the data URI scheme would be a
   nice fit for providing an uniform format for specifying events in the
   Web and printed media (QR and other formats), and we have only chosen
   another method because data support is currently limited.

   We plan to update this document with a data URI compatible format as
   soon as its support is more widespread, allowing it to be used by
   native applications, browser applications and physical media with the
   same support currently available for regular URIs.  The format
   specified here is compatible with data URI and minimal changes would
   be needed to convert from one format to another.
